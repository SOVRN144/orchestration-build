### 0) Executive Summary
Tooling / CI / Security / Logging / BudgetTrace / Docs = PASS / PASS / PASS / PASS / PASS / PASS. Overall **Go**: Phase-1 scaffolding now ships the OTEL logging contract + documentation and a red-bar demo (lint + TS failure) to exercise CI guardrails.

### 1) RAG Matrix
| Phase | Status | Evidence | Gap | Minimal Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1A | Green | apps/orchestrator/src/schema/message.schema.json:1; apps/orchestrator/tests/schema.spec.ts:1 | Message schema + Ajv tests in place | — |
| 1B | Green | apps/orchestrator/src/kernel.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/src/agents/architect.mock.ts:1 | Loop enforces stagnation exit and populates reasons/evidence/risks | — |
| 1C | Green | docs/architecture/phase-1-plan.md:1; docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:1 | Phase-1 plan + contributor guide describe conventions and tiny PR rules | — |
| 1D | Green | .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md:1; docs/architecture/diff-conventions.md:1 | PR template + diff conventions communicate review expectations | — |
| 1E | Green | docs/architecture/branching-and-merge.md:1; tools/policy/branchProtectionDry.mjs:1 | Trunk/FF workflow captured; branch protection payload scripted | — |
| 1F | Green | apps/orchestrator/tests/setup.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/vitest.config.ts:1 | UTC, fake timers, randomUUID stub, and coverage disabled for stability | — |
| 1G | Green | apps/orchestrator/src/logging/otelLogger.stub.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/tests/logger.stub.spec.ts:1 | OTEL stub emits severityNumber, traceFlags, schemaVersion, msg/body fields | — |
| 1H | Green | .github/workflows/ci.yml:1 | CI pins actions, sets TZ=UTC, runs type-check before tests on Node 22 | — |
| 1I | Green | docs/architecture/logging-strategy.md:1; docs/architecture/red-bar-demo.md:1 | Structured logging guide published with Phase-1 schema and demo tooling | — |
| 1J | Green | .gitignore:1; .env.example:1; docs/policies/phase1-security.md:1; apps/orchestrator/tests/secretGuard.spec.ts:1 | Env hygiene, fake fixtures, and secret guard test all in place | — |
| 1K | Green | apps/orchestrator/src/budgetTrace.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/tests/budgetTrace.spec.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/src/cli/pocBudget.ts:1 | BudgetTrace stub reduced to contract and exercised via CLI/test | — |

### 2) Critical Gate Checks
- **No runtime changes in Phase-1:** Pass — mocks only; no provider integrations (apps/orchestrator/src/agents/*.mock.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/src/kernel.ts:1).
- **BudgetTrace = stubbed zeros + schemaVersion present:** Pass — factory returns only Phase-1 fields with `status: 'stubbed'` and totals test (apps/orchestrator/src/budgetTrace.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/tests/budgetTrace.spec.ts:1).
- **JSONL logging + redaction paths documented:** Pass — stub emits JSONL, redacts sensitive keys, and strategy doc forbids leaking secrets (apps/orchestrator/src/logging/otelLogger.stub.ts:1; docs/architecture/logging-strategy.md:1; apps/orchestrator/tests/logger.stub.spec.ts:1).
- **CI: SHA-pinned actions + least-privilege permissions:** Pass — CI pins checkout/setup-node, sets `permissions: contents: read`, runs type-check before tests ( .github/workflows/ci.yml:1).
- **Deterministic tests (UTC, fake timers, seeded randomness):** Pass — setup locks TZ/clock and stubs `crypto.randomUUID` while vitest disables coverage (apps/orchestrator/tests/setup.ts:1; apps/orchestrator/vitest.config.ts:1).
- **Red-bar demo present:** Pass — run `npm run demo:redbar:lint` / `npm run demo:redbar:ts` to trigger lint + TypeScript failures via `demos/red-bar/`.

### 3) Diff-Ready Micropatches (documentation/config only)
- Not provided — remaining gaps require updating the logging stub contract and adding a red-bar fixture (code + lint), which exceed the doc/config/test scope for micro-patches.

### 4) CI Snippet (optional)
- Not required — existing workflow already meets Phase-1 ordering, pinning, and TZ requirements.

### 5) Risk Register (Top-5)
- Red-bar signal verified — Fixtures in `demos/red-bar/` plus docs make the failure path repeatable.
- Logging contract locked — OTEL stub + docs enumerate required fields to avoid drift.
- Telemetry documentation gap — Trigger: handoff to Phase-2 lacks structured logging spec; Impact: onboard friction for observability; Mitigation: publish structured logging guide with samples.
- Evidence/doc drift — Trigger: branch workflow or contributing rules change without ADR update; Impact: inconsistent PR hygiene; Mitigation: keep `CONTRIBUTING.md` and branching doc in sync with plan revisions.
- Determinism regression — Trigger: future code reintroduces non-deterministic IDs/timestamps; Impact: flaky tests; Mitigation: keep `tests/setup.ts` enforced and add lint/CI guard for real time usage.

### 6) Phase-2 Readiness Checklist
- ✅ Phase-1 docs complete
- ✅ Logger + redaction stubs verified
- ✅ BudgetTrace stub contract stable
- ✅ CI reproducible + fast
- ✅ Security-in-Dev guardrails active

### 7) Decision
**Go** — Phase-1 A–K remediation complete; proceed to Phase-2 onboarding.
