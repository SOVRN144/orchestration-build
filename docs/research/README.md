# Research Missions (Phases 0–17)

This folder defines the **web‑agent research** your system should complete *before* or *during* each phase of the multi‑agent dev orchestrator.

- Source of truth: `research_missions.yaml` (also available as `research_missions.json`).
- Output location: `docs/research/*.json` (one file per mission — see the `save_to` field in each mission).
- Acceptance rule: Every mission must satisfy its `acceptance_criteria` list before a phase can proceed.

## File naming & schema
Each mission in `research_missions.yaml` contains a `save_to` path like `/docs/research/p5-review-bots.json`. Your agent should write a JSON file at that path. The expected structure per **entry** is:

```json
{
  "source_url": "https://...",
  "source_title": "Title of the doc page",
  "provider_or_tool": "OpenAI / Anthropic / GitHub / CodeRabbit / etc",
  "last_updated_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "answers": { "q1": "...", "q2": "..." },
  "key_limits": {"context_tokens":"", "rpm":"", "tpm":"", "concurrency_notes":""},
  "pricing": {"input_per_million":"", "output_per_million":""},
  "capabilities": ["tool_calling","json_mode","streaming"],
  "compliance": {"data_retention":"", "training_opt_out":"", "region_routing":""},
  "snippets": ["short quote or table"]
}
```

> If multiple sources were used, write an **array of entries**. Many missions require ≥2 reputable sources.

## Running checks
Two helpers are provided in `tools/research/`:

- `checkPhase.mjs` — verifies that all missions for a phase exist and minimally validate.
- (Optional) add your own fetcher to materialize missions automatically.

### Scripts
These `package.json` scripts are included:
- `npm run research:phase -- 6` → checks all **Phase 6** missions.
- `npm run research:phase -- 0.5` → checks **Phase 0.5** missions.

## Validation rules
`checkPhase.mjs` verifies:
1. Each mission file exists at `save_to`.
2. File is either an **object** (single entry) or an **array** of entries.
3. Required keys exist: `source_url`, `source_title`, `last_updated_date`, and at least one of `answers` or `capabilities`.
4. Prints a per‑mission summary and exits **non‑zero** if any mission fails.

## Tips
- Prefer official docs (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, CodeRabbit, Canvas).
- Record **publish dates** and **version numbers** (models, SDKs).
- Copy **small** quotes/snippets only (avoid large tables; summarize).
